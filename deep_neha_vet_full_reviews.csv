"Today I visited Neha Veterinary Hospital and was impressed by its cleanliness and hygiene Although I had read reviews about the hospital before my visit, my experience exceeded expectations, The quality of service was outstanding, and the staff members were exceptionally professional Dr Azeemulla, in particular, provided excellent care and I highly recommend his consultation.
All his explanations were very clear in very simple language.convincingly I want to rate 10 also if options are there.
I saw people waiting there to meet him

Really I am very happy to see such a beautiful set up for animals",5 stars
"During my recent relocation, I needed support with my cat‚Äôs move. My cat, although 7years of age, is super scared and shy around anybody other than our family, and very talkative with us. We approached Neha Vet Hospital for help. Although the 1st visit did not go well, I revisited the Vet Clinic the same weekend and was fortunate to get full support from Dr Azeem. He guided me exactly how the anesthesia had to be administered on my cat and gave me the requisite meds etc. Relocating my cat after that was stress free and she recovered without any issues.

Thank you Dr Azeem for trusting me and supporting me wholeheartedly. My cat, Cookie, and I are happy and contended souls in our new abode üòªüòª",5 stars
"I had an amazing experience at Neha veterinary hospital The staff was incredibly friendly, professional, and caring toward my pet. The veterinarians were highly knowledgeable and took the time to explain everything in detail, ensuring my pet received the best possible care. The clinic was clean, well-organized, and equipped with modern facilities.

I truly appreciate their dedication and compassion. My pet recovered quickly thanks to their excellent treatment. I highly recommend Neha veterinary hospital to all pet owners looking for reliable and caring veterinary services!""

"Dr Azeem is very humble and kind.
He is very talented and the best veterinary doctor i know.
The first time I went to this hospital with my few days old puppy. His condition was very bad that time he was in full pain, before coming here i went to vetic , they didn't understood my puppy's case.
Then I came here, Dr Azeem cured him properly and within few minutes he became comfortable and relaxed.
A great thanks to Dr Azeem and Neha Hospital's nurses.
You Guys are Great üòÉ",5 stars
"I dont even want to give a single star for this so called  Neha speciality veterinary hospital and so called doctor Mr.Azeemulla. They are just money minded people who don't care for your pet's life... they only think about how to dig money out of you.
Because of this people i lost my little girl who was just 5yrs old. When i first took her to them, they said she has tumour and needs a surgery. Any doctor in the world who wants to perform a surgery will definitely take a blood test to know the medical condition of the dog. But these people just wanted to make the max money out of everything. They simply told us a surgery is needed and performed it. He charged us 11 thousand for this. Later we were asked to bring our pet every 3 days once for dressing, for which he charged 300 per dressing. Later my pet's situation worsened. Everytime we panicked and took her to hospital, there was shear negligence from this people. Finally my pet's final day she was taken to this hospital again beacuse her leg had swollen, we insisted him to take a blood test and discovered that her platelets had dropped down massively. If at all this blood test was taken earlier before the surgery we could have known her medical situation and improved it in the first place...with less platelets and this surgery added on to decease her health much more.People who love your pet's, sit for a while and think multiple times where you take them to for medication because at the end no one owns the responsibility of your pet's life. Taking her to government veterinary hospital would have been far better because if you have patience and time that would be the best place as they atleast care for our pets. We spent almost 40 thousand for her treatment in this hospital and still didn't receive the care that was needed for her. It's not about money, it's about losing my pet's life despite all our hope we had and believing this so called doctor and hospital that i want to highlight. We lost our pet 5 days ago and the thought she is no more is killing me so much. Hope her soul rest in peace and she comes back to me again. I am writing this review so that atleast it would save some other life.",1 star
"My experience with the hospital has been very positive.

I've had a female cat successful spayed there and the doctors were helpful throughout the process and beyond. The doctors are mostly available and help clarify queries you may have about a sick pet. My dog who experienced fur loss recovered well with the medication they administered.

Also, there's a wide variety of quality pet products avaliable, some of which they offer at discounted prices. A shout-out to the friendly staff of the place too.

I definitely recommend the place. Cheers.",5 stars
"I had an amazing experience at neha speciality Veterinary Hospital. It‚Äôs the perfect place for dogs, especially Golden Retrievers! The staff is extremely professional, caring, and knowledgeable. My Golden Retriever received excellent treatment and was vaccinated without any issues. The cost for vaccination was between 1000 to 1500, which I found reasonable for the quality of care provided.

This hospital has everything a dog owner needs, from high-quality dog food to fun toys and essential vaccines. It‚Äôs truly a one-stop shop for pet care. If you‚Äôre looking for the best care for your furry friend, I highly recommend this place!",5 stars
"I had a great experience at Neha Specificity Veterinary Hospital. The doctor is highly skilled and immediately diagnosed the issue with my pet, Pablo. The treatment was prompt and effective. I truly appreciate their expertise and care. Highly recommended!",5 stars
Visited recently. The place is a bit chaotic without any order or system. I had to wait a lot and when the doctor finally came for consultation he dint have much idea about Turtles and reptiles. Plus lot of interruptions by other people during the consultation. Need to improve on their professionalism and also have some knowledge about turtles and reptiles.,2 stars
"Money minded and sick people. Never take your pet here. Once you go there, your pet keeps getting sick every two months and you will be forced to keep going there. There‚Äôs something fishy with their treatment. Even for small issues like fever, they prescribe irrelevant medicines and a long list of things like scanning and everything and get your pet hooked up. Instead of your pet getting healthy, it becomes weak and dependant on medicines.",1 star
"I'm writing this review just to express my heartfelt gratitude to Dr.Azeemulla.. A few days back I took my 3 months old kitten, Skye here who was very sick and Dr.Azeem took quick actions and did a proper  diagnosis and test because of which we got to know our kitten had fcov. He wasn't eating food or drinking water at all.. whenever he would see food, he used to gag but after having the medicines prescribed by Dr.Azeem, Skye started showing interest in food and from the next day he even started playing like normal! I've seen other doctors in other hospitals who prescribe medicines without even doing tests and because of this I've lost one of my kittens last year but this time when my kitten, skye was sick, a friend of my friend recommended us this hospital and fortunately Dr.Azeem was available when we took our kitten there.. As we all know that a 3 month old surviving from fcov is a very rare thing and because of Dr.Azeem my kitten recovered completely from fcov within just 12-13 days and now he is again a happy, playful kitten! We took him for the usual vaccination after the recovery and the other staff members and other vet doctors were also so friendly I'll be always grateful to Dr.Azeem and the whole staff of this hospital for saving my kid.. Seeing me being worried for my baby, Dr.Azeem even calmed me by saying he'll definitely be fine within 15 days and now I know why he said that so confidently.. To everyone who is reading this review, please take your pet to this hospital if you are looking for a veterinary hospital with genuine and caring staff who are not money minded at all!! And if anyone from Neha Speciality Veterinary Hospital is reading this review, please please convey my regards and gratitude to Dr.Azeemulla üôè",5 stars

"we took our persian kitten of 6 month old to trim the matted fur on abdomin. the groomer insisted that full shaving needed and gave him a zero shave after sedative injection. this was our first time doing this for our cat and thought we could trust professionals . our cat was sick for 3 days afterwards his whole body was very closely shaved multiple times including sensitive areas the way sheep or big animals were sheared. we watched in horror the way they handled our cat. we were worried sick and wondering whether he would recover from the trauma for 3 days. now he is dull and has many scars on his abdomen where skin got severely irritated . we had a horrible experience. never going to this place. upstairs of hospital is a hall that smells very bad. many workers are there, these men seems raw and inexperienced.",1 star

"I wish there was an option to give no start
Let me tell you that if you truly care about your pet and you want your pet to recover from anything it's suffering from please don't bring it to this hell.
All they care is about money and nothing else
I got my kitten here in a critical condition and there was the worst treatment
My kitten wanted 24/7 observation and meditation but I was the only one with my kitten for the whole night no doctor was concerned about his condition
More over I had left it there morning for the day care and had to pay 1000 more for it and by the time I came back at the afternoon I see my kitten in a isolated cage with no oxygen provided nor meditation or treatment
Even one of the staff said that ""it's been like this from morning and no treatment has been given""

So please don't get your pets here I don't want any other pet to suffer like mine",1 star

"Not at all recommended if you want to provide the best treatment to your pet.

Here, the doctor's couldn't diagnose & couldn't provide the right treatment at right time due to which i lost my pet (simi - 3 month old female puppy)

Doctor's are very irresponsible & are money minded.

i have visited this hospital based on positive reviews so that i could provide my pet the best treatment i can provide her.

But the hospital & vet doctors stand no where to understand the problem & to cure it at right time.

it's been 3 months where i lost my pet & we are still unable to get out of that.

Editing this review again after reading the comment of the hospital management.
The least thing you can say is sorry instead of hurting us again.
Such a worst people & worst management & worst staff.

My pet was diagnosed with a bacterial infection(early stage) in the blood test for which the doctor has prescribed that a injection should be given daily by which she will be okay by 4-5 days.
But in spite of the medications & follow-ups taken, she collapsed after a week.
From the day 1 to day 7 we were taking a follow up on each day.
Even on the last day the doctor said she will be fine where the next day early morning she got a fits and immediately we rushed to hospital where she collapsed later that morning.",1 star

Overall, I highly recommend Neha Specialty Veterinary Hospital for all your pet's needs. The staff truly care about the well-being of your pets, and the services and facilities provided are top-notch.

I lost a cat (who ran away since they opened the door of the chamber where the cat was supposed to be treated - this incident can happened with anyone but the casual way they handled the whole incident left a bitter taste - at the end of the day, there was no empathy , no acknowledgement for this loss - I am hoping my cat (who was several injured) stays safe and someday finds it way back but I would never go back to this hospital ever again !

Doctors r knowledgeable and experienced, that's true but at the same time, I didn't expect the administration to stay silent on what happened with us.
One of their staff members touched my dog unnecessarily and inappropriately when she was very sick. Dogs too are people and they too have dignity, respect and privacy .
When I complained about it on my next visit, they promised that Mr. Azim will get back on the matter but it's been weeks now and I've not heard anything at all. Their silence is baffling, disturbing and quite upsetting. I didn't expect this kind of tragedy happening eith us at this hospital. Very sad.",1 star

We went by Dr Azeemullah's suggestion that the lump should be removed so that gait is not hampered.  She had perfect blood report a day before surgery as informed by Dr Azeemullah. Whole picture changed next day ie on 17th March when the lump was surgically removed by Dr Nageshappa. Throughout next week creatinine kept rising to 14.6 and pet died on 24th March. We repeatedly tried to reach Dr Azeemullah on  22nd March when his wife informed he is at dinner and will call back in 10 mins which never happened.  Next day again we took pet to hospital again no response from doctor, his wife says he is at a cricket match, will call back in 10 mins and pet died in hospital.  To this date Dr Azeemullah never called nor did he inform about histopathology report. Surgery department is pathetic and the doctors attitude is callous and insensitive!!",1 star

"Our pet dog was admitted into a surgery for a lump on her right hind leg. Before the surgery, the blood report showed how her Creatinine level was 0.87. We were constantly told that this is a simple surgery, both by the surgeon, Dr. Nageshappa, and Dr. Azeemullah. After the surgery, our pet's Creatinine level shot up to an alarming 9.11. The Creatinine and Bilirubin levels kept increasing after the surgery too. From a day before she left us, when her Creatinine level rose to 14.6, we tried reaching Dr. Azeemullah multiple times over phone, but we were constantly told that he'd call us back in a duration of 10 minutes, which never happened. Frustrated, we ourselves took her to the hospital, where we found out Dr. Azeemullah and some of the other doctors were busy at a cricket match while we were attempting to call him again and again. Here too, we were constantly told he would call us in 10 minutes. During one such conversation that my father was having with the receptionist, whose call Dr. Azeemullah picked up only to say he'll call in 10 minutes again, our dog passed away. We're writing this review in the hope that someone in the need for hospitalisation of thier pets knows that this place can be absolutely unresponsive and negligent.",1 star

2. Toys
3. Toiletries
4. Dry and Wet foods

"Just came with my cat now in the middle of the night for an emergency, the doctor didn‚Äôt even know what he was doing hurt Leo so bad , to give fluids he literally poked him seven times , my cat is in so much pain now , will take him somewhere else tomorrow,. If u don‚Äôt have proper staff for emergency or for night shift don‚Äôt open the hospital, we come out of desperation when we see our pets vomiting he said I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong and now we don‚Äôt know what to do. Very bad experience this is the second time",1 star
"I'm a recent visitor. Had brought my Persian kitten who was very sick and I was unhappy with the usual vet hospital I used to go to earlier.
Found prompt and empathetic treatment here from the doctors here. We had a quick diagnosis and the treatment for gastroenteritis that followed was efficient. Loved how the doctors handle the pets - says a lot about their expertise. This is a 24/7 place so makes a a reliable choice for pet parents",5 stars

Finally we have a very good 24 hr pet clinic with well trained staff round the clock . Thank you Dr Azeem- keep up the great work üôèüèº ‚Ä¶,5 stars
"It's an okay hospital for treatment. The doctor is pretty good and quite knowledgeable. The boarding is basic and not convenient at all. When we picked our dogs from there, they had a lot of pent up energy. One of our dogs peed for 2 minutes straight after coming out. I doubt they took them for a walk at all. They did not send us any video on a day to day basis which they had promised either.  They charge per dog and not per room. I might take my dogs for treatment there but not for boarding.",2 stars

"Nice hospital. Dr. Azeemulla is very experienced along with other doctors and staff. The hospital also have a one-stop shop for pets including medicines, food, toys, litter, etc. They also provide grooming and boarding for pets. There are also few cons like sometimes the doctors are a bit rough with the pets. Also, the boarding services at Neha doesn't have  human interaction/ any attention by staff.",4 stars

"It's a place who runs on your emotions. We rescued a 5month puppy with severe itching issue. Since this place was the nearest we went there. Without even looking at the pup the doctor gave a shampoo to be used.  They gave medicines and injections. And prescribed that shampoo and a spray. After applying the spray for 2 days, the itching didn't go. We took him to a pet clinic near our place in Indira Nagar. The doctor said the prescribed shampoo was for fungal infection and the spray was for something different symptoms.  Mind you both these products are expensive.  We have changed the shampoo and can now see instant result.  This place encashes on your mental state and pushes expensive useless stuff",1 star

"The only Doctor we trust with our fur babies. We have three dogs and they have always been treated with the best medication and we have seen positive improvements constantly. We completely trust Doctor Azim with our fur babies and could not have asked for a better doctor to take care of their medical needs. Not just the doctor, but all the staff are very friendly and attentive. The hospital itself is clean and hygienic and always sanitized.Would definitely recommend Dr.Azim for any medical emergency or medical treatment for you pets.üíØ",5 stars
"This clinic is nothing but showoff! Please don't take your Pets to him. He is just concerned about money not about curing the pet. I lost my dog because of his negligence and asks you to do unnecessary tests especially blood test! when my dog was on its death bed he charged us a bomb for nothing and by the time we came home my pet passed away ü•∫ I feel government veterinary hospital treats better..
If you are concerned about your pet please don't take it to him!",1 star

"Today I had been there to Neha Speciality hospital with my baby because she had swallowed a button battery (not just one) and I rushed there with her with no hopes understanding how dangerous it is for my baby.. The doctors were so good they took her x-ray and found out 2 button battery and one small metal piece inside her stomach and they gave the medication asap and they made her puke & later gave her drip and other necessary medicines.. I‚Äôll always be grateful for this.. I don‚Äôt have words to thank you enough. I just ignored the negative reviews and went there with my baby who was in such a critical condition and she‚Äôs completely fine other than her tiredness! I‚Äôll never take my Zelda anywhere else other than Neha Speciality Hospital. THANK YOU SOO MUCH DOCTORS & EACH ONE OF YOUR STAFF, you guys were not only taking care of my child you were there support me as well. ‚ù§Ô∏è 1000% recommended for pet parents",5 stars
"I've been to this vet twice with my kitten telling them that it's not eating anything they didn't check my kitten properly and it's dehydrated and had less blood all of these things I got to know when I went to the other vet because all I got to hear from this vet was my kitten is fine and it's been 2 days it's not drinking water and other vet told that he has 50% chances of staying alive because the doctor I took him to could not figure out that in time.

If it was malnutrition it was that doctor's duty to tell me that he was not fine,  every time I visited all he said was cat is fine where he should have taken his blood sample and checked him properly you guys have opend vet you should know what to do if I knew what was wrong I would have treated him on my own it was your job to tell me he was not fine you are the doctor if u have the title do your job properly because we're paying for it you're not doing it for free, also I left happily because that illiterate doctor who did not know his job told me my cat is fine without even checking him of course I believed him because he is the so called doctor who has no idea how to perform his duty.
When I took my pet to another vet they told me if you wouldn't have neglected the symptoms and condition my kitten would have been fine by now and would have recovered.
Also learn to accept your mistakes and own it up. narcissistic clinic
I hope your clinic shuts down.
To the person who is reading this I beg to you not take your pet in this hospital they don't have manners and don't know how to do their job.",1 star

"The Service Provided by Dr, Azeem , Dr. Salman and their Team is excellent.  They are very Knowledgeable , kind, Attentive, patient and will answer every question you have. Dr. Azeem, helped save my cats life, and made sure there was a proper Diagnosis for the illness. Whereas other Vets that I had been to before misdiagnosed my cat and could have lead to his death. But thankfully I was guided every step of the way by Dr. Azeem and the Team! They are very hardworking and do everything possible to save lives. And for that my blessings are with them.
Dr. Azeem has expanded his Professional Practice into a Large Scale Hospital which is Very  Well Built and Designed. It‚Äôs Spacious, Clean and Well Equipped! And they are open 24/7 which is an absolute live saver!",5 stars
"I lost my dearest friend (also my first dog) by the sheer irresponsibility of the Doctor Azeem. My dog had fell and injured his leg. Instead of inspecting the leg carefully - which was his sole duty, he asked us to take Xray and just took a glance over it and instructed the compounder to put a plaster of Paris over the leg and asked us to visit after 1 month and charged a hefty fee. He did not even inspected the dog's leg carefully because of which he missed an open wound and soon inside the POP plaster that open wound started to infect his leg and the infection spread all over this body. We got to know about the infection only after the fowl smell that started coming after couple of days when we visited two other hospital for different opinions it was clear that POP plaster was the reason for the infection and there were no provision for air circulation also in that POP plaster and by then the whole leg was infected and it had spread to his vital organs. It was too late for us to save my dog. may his soul rest in peace! and the other doctor had said that the Neha Hospital has several court cases against them and also he said - THEY ARE ONLY CONCERNED ABOUT BREEDS NOT STRAYS!",1 star
First visit has been highly satisfying. The pet groomer was very efficient & caring. Excellent experience with Ms. Anjum & her team. Will definitely recommend this facility & also visit again. Thank you so very much!,5 stars

"The doctor is very good he has treated our pet dog very well., for CCL with oral medicine, but when my pet had a lump on her leg we were advised surgery , and the surgery was planned, after the blood test, which was absolutely normal, and our pet very healthy, the surgery was done the next day by Dr. Nageshappa and immediately after the surgery we took her home next day she refused to take anything orally so we took her to the hospital and her blood test done and to our shock her creatinine and bilirubin levels had risen alarmingly, every two days her blood test was done and it was increasing every time, and ultimately she expired after 7 days of trauma. SO OUR SINCERE ADVICE WILL BE, NOT TO GO FOR SURGERY HERE AS THEY DO NOT HAVE A COMPETENT SURGERY DEPARTMENT. THOUGH THIS HOSPITAL HAS AN EXCELLENT MEDICINE DEPARTMENT IN DR. AZEEMULLAH.",1 star
