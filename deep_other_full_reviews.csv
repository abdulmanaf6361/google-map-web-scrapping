"I had taken my pet to Shwana clinic as he had puked blood + 12 more pukes. It was the first time I took my pet to the clinic, that too in a critical condition. But this was the best decision!

We're eternally grateful to Dr. Swati and the team for caring for Rooski and giving him minimal yet necessary medication. From the diagnosis to care, everything was great. We're back home with a healthy pupper who has shopped for a few new toys too!

Thank you Doctor Swati and team üôè",5 stars
"Absolutely DO NOT take your pet to this clinic.

If you care about your pet, stay far away from this place. The doctors here are under-experienced and seem to treat animals like test subjects. They gave my beloved pet excessive medication without even knowing what was wrong ‚Äî just blindly trying out treatments. This negligence led to my pet's death.

They are completely money-minded, have no sense of time or urgency, and lack empathy. It‚Äôs clear they‚Äôre more focused on profits than proper care. Clinics like this should not be allowed to operate. They are dangerous to innocent lives.

Please be cautious. Don‚Äôt let what happened to my pet happen to yours.",1 star
"This clinic is an amazing place to take to your pets doctors here are very friendly. The clinic is very clean , they also have multiple products to sell also they give good discounts i would highly recommend this clinic for your pets.",5 stars
"I lost my cat yesterday. I am not sure if treatment given was right or not. But after visiting my cats health deteriorated and he started foaming from mouth too much.
They had not told me my cat could die or anything like that. I believed treatment will help him.

Called them in the evening as he was getting worse they said no doctor available and suggested to try give creamy treat and bring back in the morning.

My cat was gone by morning . I can‚Äôt bring him back now, I can only regret and cry for rest of my life thinking of what could I have done differently to save him.

Here is a summary-
Took my cat as he had quit eating for 2 days.
He ate half boiled chicken at boarding which he couldn‚Äôt digest (he only ate fully boiled chicken at home ) and pooped and puked in bed. He stopped eating right after.

Day 3 took him to Shwana, diagnosed with below
‚Ä¢     Fever (105.4¬∞F)
‚Ä¢ Salivation/ dehydration
‚Ä¢ Flatulence, abdominal pain
‚Ä¢ Low WBC, low platelets
‚Ä¢ Extremely high SGPT (>1000)
‚Ä¢ Suspected viral infection or Mycoplasmosis

Treatment Given:
‚Ä¢ Inj. Meloxicam (0.2 mg/kg, SC): Pain relief and anti-inflammatory
‚Ä¢ Inj. DNS (30 ml IV) + Inj. RL (30 ml IV): IV fluids to support hydration and recovery
‚Ä¢ Inj. T-one or C-one(20 mg IV): Likely an antibiotic
‚Ä¢ Inj. : Enefest (something written like this) (2.2 mg/kg IV): Broad-spectrum antibiotic
‚Ä¢ Inj. Pantoprazole (1 mg/kg IV): Protects stomach lining",1 star
"If your pets suffer and diseases or illness please don't trust such clinics......the treatment is very slow and is focused on generating more revenue. I request you keep such clinics only for general checkup and go to well reputed hospitals for better care incase of diseases. Most of the important medicines are not available and if prescribed by reputed doctors they then ask to get them if you want them. The negligence is subpar.
For serious illness or diseases please go to well known bigger hospitals with better facilities and doctors.",1 star
"I had the worst ever experience in this clinic. My pet was bruced in the groin area, (on Testicles with the trimmer). I immediately called the clinic and demanded to talk to the doctor. Response from the doctor"" when you shave at home, even you have cuts"".

I have no words to express how my little pet suffered. He couldn't sit or sleep. Impatient, sleepless, tired and restless.

It's up to you guys to decide if you want your pets in inhuman hands who treat animals like a lifeless money making Machine.",1 star
"Worst clinic ever. Please please don't take your pet here. I lost my pet because of their inhuman attitude. Doctor doesn't seems like a doctor. He will just ask you what's the problem with your pet and then will medicines and injections according to that only.
Areeey if you are a doctor then you should come first and check by yourself what is the issue and condition of the dog then according should inject the medicines.
My dog was perfectly fine until they gave him some very high dosage of injections. Even after I told them about the condition that due to the previous injections he was not able to properly walk also and was doing vomiting continuously, still they were not bothered and next day also in that condition gave him a very high dosage of medicine which is made to work 14 days medicine in one dose only. and finally his body couldn't able to digest that medicine and he passed away....

I request you guysüôèüôè please consult to a professional doctor or clinic who will treat your dog like their own not like these who are just a money making machine.

OM SHANTIüôè",1 star

Pathetic Service. No professionalism. I booked an appointment for Grooming 2 days before and appointment was given at 3pm on Sunday. I had rescheduled all my other important appointments because these people gave me an appointment at 3pm. I got a call from them at 2:45pm stating the appointment has been rescheduled to 4pm. The entire day of my schedule has been screwed up because of this. They didn't even have a curtosy to apologize for this change. Very rude behaviour. I would not recommend this clinic.,1 star

"We visited the clinic for the grooming of our 2 Persian cats. One of our cat is very aggressive and never allows us to comb his hair. As a result his full body hair were tangled into many knots and then we decided to trim their hair.
Talking about the service of this clinic, they are very well trained and experienced in handling the pets. Clinic is very hygienic.

"Firstly I had taken my 3yr old Oreo (beagle pup) for general consultation for her conjunctivitis. I was very happy with the way she was treated in the clinic and the staff was super friendly. I could trust them for my dogs neutering surgery which I wanted to do since long time but wanted someone trustworthy.
Her blood test was done a day prior and next morning was the surgery. Throughout the surgery she was taken well care of by Dr. Abhishek. It took 2-3 days for her to recover and I was really worried for her during initial 2 nights.
However, the assistance which i received from Dr. Swathi was commendable. She was available day or night on call and WhatsApp whenever I needed any support. She proactively kept a check on my dogs health recovery and gave all needful advise until her complete recovery.
My dog is completely perfect and back to the crazy version of herüòç. My overall experience with this clinic and the staff and doctors has been wonderful ‚ù£Ô∏è and I would highly recommend this place to everyone.
Also, they have good range of pet supplies and assist you in buying the right products for ur pets.
